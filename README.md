# Air Quality Analysis in Cities

## üîç Project Overview

This project analyzes air quality data from multiple cities to understand pollution patterns, identify environmental trends, and provide insights into urban air quality conditions. Through interactive Jupyter notebooks, the analysis explores Air Quality Index (AQI) measurements, pollutant concentrations, and their relationships with various urban factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing and array operations
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Static plotting and visualization
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization

## üìã Features

- **Air Quality Data Processing**: Cleaning and preprocessing AQI measurements and pollutant data
- **Environmental Data Exploration**: Statistical analysis of air pollution patterns across cities
- **AQI Visualization**: Interactive charts showing Air Quality Index trends and comparisons
- **Pollutant Analysis**: Detailed examination of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and other air pollutants
- **City Comparisons**: Comparative analysis of air quality across different urban areas
- **Health Impact Assessment**: Correlation between AQI levels and health risk categories

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/louisnguyenn/Global_Air_Quality_Data_Analysis.git
   cd Global_Air_Quality_Data_Analysis
   ```

2. **Download Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   python -m notebook
   ```

## üìä Analysis Highlights

### Key Findings
- **AQI Distribution**: Analysis of Air Quality Index levels across surveyed cities
- **Pollution Hotspots**: Identification of cities with consistently poor air quality
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Temporal variations in air quality measurements
- **Pollutant Correlations**: Relationships between different air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.)
- **Health Risk Assessment**: Classification of cities by AQI health risk categories

### Air Quality Insights
- Cities with highest and lowest average AQI values
- Most common pollutants contributing to poor air quality
- Temporal trends showing improvement or deterioration over time
- Statistical analysis of pollutant concentrations and their health implications
